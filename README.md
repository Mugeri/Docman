## Models

Three models are defined: `Roles`, `Users` and `Documents`. `Roles` must have a unique title on their creation. A `User` must have a `Role` defined for them. The routes are defined under `server/models`.

## Testing

Testing is achieved through use of `enzyme`, `mocha` and `chai` packages. `enzyme` is used to simulate react events while testing. `mocha` is the testing framework and `chai` is the exception library. They will both be installed when you run `npm install` and the tests will run with the command `npm test`.

## Routes

The routes are defined using `react-router`.

## Mongo Database

Ensure that you have installed `mongodb` locally or substitute with one of the available
cloud mongo databases. Before you go ahead to run the tests or work with the api, run `mongod` on a separate tab on your terminal. Add the configuration to the db connection in your `.env` file. Each time tests are run or the app is run, the database is dropped and seeded.
